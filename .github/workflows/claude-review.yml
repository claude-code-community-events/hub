            Review this PR for the claude-code-community-events/hub repo.

            Check:
            1. Event folders follow the naming convention: events/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-city
            2. Each event has a README.md with the required fields (date, location, luma link, hosts)
            3. Speaker folders have a README.md
            4. No video files committed (should be links only)
            5. No promotional or spam content disguised as event materials
            6. File sizes are reasonable (warn on >5MB, flag >50MB)
            7. No sensitive information (API keys, passwords, personal data beyond names)

            Be concise. Only comment on actual issues.
