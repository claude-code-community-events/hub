# Events

All events are organized by year and month:

```
events/
└── YYYY/
    └── MM/
        └── YYYY-MM-DD-city/
            ├── README.md
            └── speakers/
                └── your-name/
```

## Naming

- Folder: `YYYY-MM-DD-city` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- Date matches the Luma event date
- City is lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `new-york`, `chiang-mai`, `sao-paulo`)
